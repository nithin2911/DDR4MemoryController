## DDR4MemoryController ####

#### Introduction ####

This project implements a DDR4 Memory Controller in SystemVerilog.  


The project aims at Designing a DDR4 RAM using System Verilog with improved efficiency of the system in terms of: Data rate, increased read/write operations speed, faster burst access and reduce memory power demand.  
This project doesnt include an extensive testbench. However a Testbench included has different operating modes that are commented and can be simulated for each mode by un-commenting and simulating accordingly.  The top module can be replaced with a more exhastive testbench/UVM environment.  
This project was originally developed using SV and simulated using Cadence Xcelium Logic Simulator.
