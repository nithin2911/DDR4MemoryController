## DDR4MemoryController ####

#### Introduction ####

This project implements a DDR4 Memory Controller in SystemVerilog.  


The main objective of the project was to implement a virtual DDR4 Memory controller using System Verilog. The project deals with performing burst read/write operations into the memory at different address locations based on various functional FSM states of operation. 
This project doesnt include an extensive testbench. However a Testbench included has different operating modes that are commented and can be simulated for each mode by un-commenting and simulating accordingly.  The top module can be replaced with a more exhastive testbench/UVM environment.  
This project was originally developed using SV and simulated using Cadence Xcelium Logic Simulator.  
The supporting documents used for the presentation of this project has also been attatched alongwith the project code for further reference.
